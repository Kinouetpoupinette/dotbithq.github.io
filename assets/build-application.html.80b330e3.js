Unlike other personal homepage products, the information displayed on bit.cc&#39;s homepage is stored decentrally. Only .bit account owners who can modify it, and bit.cc cannot delete your profile.</p><p>If Alice owns alice.bit and adds her own links to various social networks in the resolution record, bit.cc will display these links in an extremely beautiful way, accessible to other users via alice.bit.cc. The performance of bit.cc is completely controlled by Alice through the setting of the resolution record. For example.</p><ol><li>Alice can decide whether to display your decentralized profile in light mode or dark mode by setting the value of the resolution record <code>custom_key.bitcc_theme</code> to <code>light</code> or <code>dark</code>.</li><li>Alice can set the value of the resolution record <code>custom_key.bitcc_redirect</code> to a link to Alice&#39;s personal website. This way, when someone visits alice.bit.cc, the page will automatically redirect to alice&#39;s personal website.</li></ol><p>These features are possible because bit.cc is responding based on Alice&#39;s resolution records. In the future, bit.cc will be able to present all of Alice&#39;s NFTs based on Alice&#39;s resolution records. alice.bit.cc will be a truly decentralized personal home page for Alice.</p>',9),_={href:"https://github.com/dotbitHQ/bit.cc",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},f=t("bit.cc docs"),m=e("h2",{id:"preparation",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#preparation","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" Preparation")],-1),g=e("p",null,"The preparation work required to develop different types of applications varies.",-1),k=e("p",null,"If a .bit account is a practical NFT asset, develop a trading/auction/rental marketplace for .bit.
